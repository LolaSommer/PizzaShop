## 🍕 PizzaShop — modern responsive pizza delivery UI

PizzaShop is a fully responsive, accessible landing page and ordering interface for a pizza-delivery service.
Built with clean SCSS architecture and vanilla JavaScript, it focuses on **UI logic, state management, and realistic product behavior** rather than static layouts.

The project simulates a real-world e-commerce flow: product selection, customization, cart management, authentication preview, and multi-page navigation.

## 🧩 Features

### 🔥 Core functionality

* Fully responsive layout (mobile → desktop)
* Adaptive SCSS architecture (BEM + partials)
* Clean component-based UI structure
* Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
* Keyboard accessibility and ARIA attributes for modals
* Lighthouse optimized (100/100/100/100)

---

## 🛒 Cart & Ordering Logic

* Add pizzas to cart with selected:

  * size
  * crust type
  * ingredients
  * quantity

* Smart cart state management:

  * identical pizzas are merged (same size, crust, ingredients)
  * ingredient lists are sorted for safe comparison
  * dynamic total count & price calculation
  * correct update and removal logic

* Add-on products (extras):

  * dynamic show / hide logic
  * independent quantity handling

* Side cart (slide-in panel):

  * animated open / close
  * body scroll lock handling
  * synchronized UI state across modals

---

## 🍕 Product Details Modal

* Full product information displayed in a modal:

  * pizza image and description
  * size selector (10" / 12" / 14")
  * traditional / thin crust toggle
  * selectable additional ingredients
* Real-time price updates based on selection
* Scrollable ingredients panel (right side)
* Clean modal state reset on close
* Accessible focus handling and keyboard support

---

## 🔐 Authentication (SPA-style preview logic)

The project includes a **single-page authentication flow simulation**, designed as UI/UX and state-logic preview:

* Login & Registration modals
* Registration flow with:

  * email form
  * referral program participation (UI logic)
* Social login buttons:

  * Google
  * Facebook
  * Apple

> Social buttons copy the corresponding social link to clipboard
> and automatically close the modal, simulating a completed action.

* Modal transitions and blurred background
* ARIA-labeled inputs and buttons
* No backend — focus on **frontend logic and UX behavior**

---

## 📰 Blog & Storytelling Page

A separate content-driven page focused on brand storytelling rather than sales:

* Editorial layout with visual hierarchy
* Action-oriented CTA buttons
* Context-aware navigation (no menu/cart logic here)

### Dynamic modals on blog page:

* **Kitchen Tour**

  * interactive modal with booking form
* **Meet the Crew**

  * reused modal with dynamic content injection

These modals share logic but adapt content dynamically based on user action.

Planned Improvements (Optional / Future Ideas)

The project is considered feature-complete in its current scope.
The following items are optional extensions, not required for the core experience:

Promo-code system (UI logic only)

Mock API integration for product data

Dark theme toggle

Deeper automated testing for cart logic

(LocalStorage persistence and form validation are already implemented.)
